There are many cases that document self-starvation for religious purposes. However, the first medical description of self-starvation was recorded in 1689 by Morton who characterized loss of appetite, fasting and extreme weight loss as <i>nervous atrophy</i>/<i>nervous consumption</i> after observing these symptoms in one boy and one girl. It wasn’t until 1873 that Sir William Gull introduced the term <i>anorexia nervosa</i> to medical literature to describe cases of significant weight loss that also included many symptoms associated with eating disorders today.

The men were restricted to 1500 calories a day for 6 months. Results from this experiment revealed profound psychological effects, including loss of social skills and aggression. Following the experiment, the men gained more weight than when they first started the experiment, showing that trying to lose weight through restricting your food intake is not effective.'},
	'h-300' : {q: '<span class="q">Bulimic behaviors can be seen in history as far back as the ancient Egyptians</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Ancient texts reveal that vomiting was used as a form of "self-cleansing". Ancient Egyptians supposedly purged monthly to empty their stomachs. The Ancient Romans used self-induced vomiting following the practice overeating. By the 18th century, vomiting was prescribed as a remedy for excessive eating and weight loss.'},
	'h-400' : {q: '<span class="q">Binge eating disorder has not always been recognized as its own eating disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Characteristics of binge eating disorder (BED) were first described in 1959. It wasn’t until 1994 that BED was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) under Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS). Finally, in 2013 BED was added to the DSM as an official eating disorder. '},
	'h-500' : {q: '<span class="q">Historical accounts of eating disorder behaviors are irrelevant and insignificant to modern medicine</span>', a: 'm', e: 'Historical accounts of eating disorders describe significant behavioral features that can still be seen today. Doctors and researchers can use these accounts to learn about the biological impacts of behaviors associated with eating disorders and apply this knowledge to treatment development. Many historical accounts emphasize characteristic behaviors that are classified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5), which is used to assess and diagnose modern eating disorders.'},
	't-100' : {q: '<span class="q">You have to be skinny to have an eating disorder</span>', a: 'm', e: 'Not all eating disorders are characterized by low body weight. While the presence of an eating disorder may result in significant weight loss, eating disorders characterize abnormal eating behaviors and/or disturbed perception of self-body image. For example, ARFID is an eating disorder that is characterized by restricted food intake that is unrelated to lack of food availability and does not result in a disturbance in body weight or shape. This eating disorder is unrelated to body weight or body image; it is associated with unusual eating habits. However, eating disorders that are associated with body weight or body image can appear in an individual of any weight or BMI.'},
	't-200' : {q: '<span class="q">There are only two types of eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia</span>', a: 'm', e: 'The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition(DSM-V) recognizes 8 different types of feeding and eating disorders. These include:<ul><li>Pica</li><li>Rumination Disorder</li><li>Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)</li><li>Anorexia Nervosa (Restrictive and Binge-purge types)</li><li>Bulimia Nervosa</li><li>Binge-Eating Disorder</li><li>Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder</li><li>Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder</li></ul>'},
	't-300' : {q: '<span class="q">Eating disorders often co-occur with psychiatric disorders</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Some of the psychiatric disorders that commonly co-occur with eating disorders include: depression, bipolar disorder, OCD, social anxiety, generalized anxiety (GAD), PTSD, borderline personality disorder (BPD), substance abuse and suicidality. Around 50-65% of individuals with BN have major depression disorder (MDD) while 46-80% of individuals with AN-BP also suffer from MDD. An impressive 54% of patients diagnosed with BPD also suffer from some type of eating disorder.'},
	't-400' : {q: '<span class="q">All eating disorders are treated the same</span>', a: 'm', e: 'There are various different treatment levels depending on the severity of the eating disorder. The highest level of treatment is inpatient treatment, which is required for medical stabilization. Behavioral therapy also begins in inpatient therapy to begin stabilization of symptoms. The next level is residential therapy, which data suggests is not an effective form of treatment. While residential therapy provides round the clock supervision, all triggering and harming items are taken away. This prevents patients from learning how to deal and manage with the stressors and triggers of the real world. Next is partial hospitalization (PHP) day treatment which begins at 10 hours down to 6 hours. This provides patients with the chance to go home everyday and learn to manage the reality of life. However, it also ensures that patients are eating as they are often required to eat 2-3 meals and snacks at the program each day. After completing partial hospitalization, patients move to intensive outpatient (IOP) therapy which provides small treatment for support. At this stage in therapy, patients are expected to resume a normal life including returning to school or work. Lastly is outpatient therapy in which the level of care is determined by the severity of the case.'},
	't-500' : {q: '<span class="q">An Eating Disorders Examination can be used to assess the presence of an eating disorder</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Professionals use an Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) to get baselines for understanding patients with potential eating disorders. Along with an EDE, many other assessments may be conducted to gauge eating disorder behaviors and symptoms, eating disorder history, thought process, mental disorder diagnoses, substance use, psychosocial behavior, and medical symptoms. In these assessments, it is important to determine why the patient is seeking treatment. Many lack insight into when symptoms first began to manifest; therefore, it is common to have people close to the patient come to the evaluation to help provide insight.'},
	'm-100' : {q: '<span class="q">Eating disorders can only affect the gastrointestinal system</span>', a: 'm', e: 'Significant weight loss from an eating disorder can affect every system in the body including the cardiovascular, fluid and electrolyte, neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, reproductive, musculoskeletal, hematologic, immunologic, dermatologic, respiratory and dental systems.'},
	'm-200' : {q: '<span class="q">Those who suffer from eating disorders will be completely healthy after treatment</span>', a: 'm', e: 'If an individual suffers from an eating disorder during the "critical window" of growth and development, medical complications that resulted from weight loss can be permanent. These irreversible changes are usually related to body changes related to growth and development during puberty and may include decreased height growth, delayed puberty, decreased bone density, and changes in cognition.'},
	'm-300' : {q: '<span class="q">You need to be skinny to be malnourished</span>', a: 'm', e: 'Malnutrition can be classified by a low BMI or by measures of significant weight loss; therefore, one can be malnourished yet maintain a normal or high BMI. A change in weight, including the amount of weight lost and the time frame of weight loss (how fast), is a stronger determinant of malnutrition severity. Severe malnutrition is classified by a loss of 20% or more in body weight over a one year period OR a loss of 10% or more in body weight over a 6 month period.'},
	'm-400' : {q: '<span class="q">The number one cause of death from eating disorders is related to cardiac issues</span>', a: 'f', e: 'The cardiac system experiences many changes from malnutrition due to eating disorders with the most significant change being bradycardia, or low heart rate. A normal heart rate for the average adult is around 60-100 bpm (beats per minute). An individual with bradycardia has a heart rate of 45bpm or less, putting them at increased risk for cardiac arrest which is the #1 cause of death among individuals with eating disorders. Malnourishment can also cause the body to eat away at the heart for nutrients, decreasing the ventricular wall mass and decreasing the pumping efficiency of the heart. These structural changes coupled with bradycardia lower the blood and oxygen circulation throughout the body, which can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and acrocyanosis (cold and blue hands and feet).'},
	'm-500' : {q: '<span class="q">When it comes to mortality, you are better off being addicted to heroin than suffering from an eating disorder</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness with approximately 10% of eating disorder cases resulting in death. The number one cause of death from eating disorders relates to cardiac issues. Suicide is the second leading cause of death.'},
	'c-100' : {q: '<span class="q">Eating disorders only affect Americans</span>', a: 'm', e: 'Sociocultural Theory of eating disorders supports that the development of eating disorders stems from societal and cultural pressures that increase the internalization of the thin ideal and body dissatisfaction. This theory is supported by the existence of differences within and across-groups based on exposure to culture. In a study to show the effects of Western culture on the rates of eating disorders, incidence rates of eating disorders were examined in countries prior to exposure to Western culture.</p> <p>Curacao, a small country in the Caribbean, was experiencing  a socioeconomic transition into a newly affluent country in the mid to late 1990s. The study found that the incidence rates of eating disorders were lower overall when compared to the United States, but found that the rates of the white and mixed race women were comparable to affluent Western countries. There were 0 cases of anorexia nervosa found among the black women. This is believed to be because the white and mixed race women were of higher socioeconomic status and were exposed to Western ideals through things such as travel. </p><p>Another study looked at the country of Fiji before and after exposure to television. Prior to the introduction of TV, there was positivity surrounding larger, fuller bodies, with low levels of body dissatisfaction and low dieting and purging. However, television lead to the association between wealth/success and thinness and a rate of 11% self-induced purging was found. These studies show that eating disorders do not just occur in America; they can be found in cultures that have been exposed to Western influences.'},
	'c-200' : {q: '<span class="q">Eating disorders can’t affect racial and ethnic minorities</span>', a: 'm', e: 'While some may believe that men and women of minorities are immune to eating disorders, it has been found that minorities, especially women of minorities, may be more vulnerable to developing an eating disorder. This is due to the the stress that minorities face from just being a minority group, but also from the exposure and acculturation to the Western identity which is associated with higher rates of eating disorders. The pressure of membership in multiple groups along with environmental stress can induce eating disorders.'},
	'c-300' : {q: '<span class="q">Eating disorders are only influenced by culture</span>', a: 'm', e: 'While a particular gene has not been identified as a cause for eating disorders, it has been found that culture alone can not account for eating disorders. Since anorexia nervosa (AN) behaviors have been documented throughout history and rates of cases have remained relatively constant, it is believed that AN could exist without culture. Neither genes nor culture alone can be found as the cause of eating disorders; it is likely that it is more of an interaction between genes and culture. Individuals can have a genetic predisposition to developing an eating disorder, and when exposed to environmental influences (culture) and lead to its onset.'},
	'c-400' : {q: '<span class="q">Bulimia exists only in cultures exposed to Western ideals</span>', a: 'f', e: 'When comparing rates of eating disorders between cultures that have been exposed to Western culture and those sheltered from Western ideals, results showed that bulimia nervosa (BN) does not exist in cultures without Western exposure. Therefore, it is believed that BN is more influenced by culture. Supporting evidence includes a significant increase in the number of BN cases in the later half of the 20th century and a lack of BN cases in early historical texts. Surprisingly, it is believed that anorexia nervosa (AN) would exist without culture as some cases of AN could not be connected to Western culture. Cases of AN have been identified throughout history and the rate of AN cases has remained relatively constant over time.'},
	'c-500' : {q: '<span class="q">Men are less sensitive to external pressures regarding body image</span>', a: 'm', e: 'The Tripartite and Dual Pathway Models illustrate the development of eating disorders. Both models support that cultural ideals pressure individuals to follow and maintain cultural norms and that internalization of the thin ideal is used to relieve those cultural pressures. Internalization of the thin ideal is the degree to which an individual’s awareness of their body ideal correlates to body dissatisfaction; high internalization of the thin ideal means thinking a lot about being thin and believing oneself that thinness is important. For men, there is a stronger emphasis on being fit and muscular rather than being thin. While men are preached a different message, they are still exposed to similar influences that women are exposed to. However, it has been found that men experience less internalization and are therefore more sensitive to external pressures such as peers, parents, and media.'},
	'n-100' : {q: '<span class="q">There are certain temperaments and personality traits that are exhibited by individuals with eating disorders</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Individuals with eating disorders display certain temperament and personality traits that are important to the development and maintenance of the eating disorder. These traits are related to the neural circuits that are responsible for irregular appetite and disordered eating behavior. Some characteristics include:<ul><li>elevated anxiety/harm avoidance</li><li>altered reward sensitivity</li><li>altered cognitive flexibility/inhibition</li><li>altered interoceptive awareness</li></ul>'},
	'n-200' : {q: '<span class="q">Anxiety disorder is strongly correlated with eating disorders</span>', a: 'f', e: 'A study done across different countries/continents comparing the rates of anxiety disorder (AD) and eating disorders (ED) revealed that around 2/3rds of ED cases existed in patients with a history of AD. Anxiety can be seen in many eating disorders; in anorexia, food leads to a sense of anxiousness. It is believed that this anxiousness is the driving force for restrictive eating behavior.'},
	'n-300' : {q: '<span class="q">Treatment of eating disorders requires fixing eating habits only</span>', a: 'm', e: 'Although there is no one brain "center" for eating disorders, altered neural responses in patients with eating disorders reveals a neurological basis for their behavior. Knowledge on temperament and personality traits in those with eating disorders, which are supported by neural circuit function, help provide more effective treatment. It has been found that treatments that lack psychiatric support and therapy are inadequate for patients with chronic eating disorders. With developing knowledge on how behavior is encoded in the brain, new treatments can be designed to target those mechanisms, improving effectiveness and decreasing the likelihood of relapse.'},
	'n-400' : {q: '<span class="q"> Individuals with anorexia experience abnormal reinforcement of reward and inhibition from eating</span>', a: 'f', e: 'Our brain learns through reward and punishment. We reinforce positive experiences with a reward, which increases future motivation through the limbic circuit. Similarly, we learn to avoid experiences that we find aversive through the cognitive control circuit. Individuals with anorexia experience stronger control of their cognitive control circuit, leading to difficulty in encoding reward and motivation. A study testing the gustatory response to sweet taste, a primary motivator of behavior, resulted in decreased responsiveness to sucrose in those with anorexia. This revealed that the brain was under responsive (when compared to control) to reward in patients with anorexia.'},
	'n-500' : {q: '<span class="q">Eating disorders are a choice</span>', a: 'm', e: 'While it may appear that those with eating disorders have made a choice to exhibit eating disorder behavior, neurobiological evidence proves otherwise. For example, in a study that looked at the effect of taste on activation in the brain from hunger, patients with anorexia nervosa showed abnormally low activation when hungry. This suggests that they are less sensitive to reward and therefore experience decreased motivation from hunger. With diminished food reward motivation, patients with anorexia are more likely to exhibit food restricting behaviors. Their restrictive behavior can be explained through the fault of their neurobiology. While neurobiology is not the only influence in the development of eating disorders, it is a strong indicator that eating disorders are not up to personal choice. '}

	'history' : {title: '<b>History of Eating Disorders</b>', info: '<h5>What are the earliest cases of anorexia?</h5><p>The earliest cases of self-starvation dates all the way back to the late 4th century and were often associated with demonic possession. From 700-1000AD, St. Wilgefortis was popularized as the "bearded saint" throughout Europe. She exhibited symptoms of modern anorexia including extreme food restriction and body hair growth resulting from malnutrition. In 1200 AD, Saint Catherine of Siena, St. Veronica, and other religious ascetics practiced self-starvation for religious purposes, which became known as "holy anorexia."</p><h5>When was bulimia first recognized?</h5><p>While bulimic behaviors have been recorded in ancient texts, it wasn’t until 1979 that Bulimia Nervosa was formally characterized by Gerald Russell. As early as the ancient Egyptians, bulimic behaviors have been documented, often being used as a form of cleansing or relief from overeating. It wasn’t until 1940 that weight and body shape dissatisfaction was described and in the 1960s, weight and size were officially recognized as motivators for bulimic behaviors. Russell referred to the bulimic behaviors he observed as an "ominous variant of AN," with individuals expressing fears of gaining weight and using purging as a mechanism for weight loss. Russell’s sign, named after Gerald Russell, describes the calluses found on the knuckles of individuals who repeatedly self-induce vomiting. Following Russell’s descriptions of bulimia, bulimia nervosa was included in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) in 1980.</p>'},
	'types' : {title: '<b>Assessment and Diagnosis of Eating Disorders</b>', info: '<h5>What are the different types of eating disorders?</h5><p>The DSM-V recognizes 8 different types of feeding and eating disorders. These include:<ul><li><b>Pica: </b><p>Continuous ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances (ex. chalk) over a period of one month that is not culturally or developmentally appropriate of the individual</p></li><li><b>Rumination Disorder: </b><p>Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least one month that is not associated with a gastrointestinal or other medical condition</p></li><li><b>Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID): </b><p>Continual failure to meet appropriate nutritional needs that is not related to lack of food availability and does not result in a disturbance in body weight or shape.</p></li><li><b>Anorexia Nervosa: </b><p>Restriction of energy intake that leads to significant weight loss and is associated with a fear of gaining weight and distorted body perception</p></li><li><b>Bulimia Nervosa: </b><p>Recurrent episodes of binging followed by episodes of compensatory purging through measures such as vomiting, exercise, fasting, and/or laxative use</p></li><li><b>Binge-Eating Disorder: </b><p>Recurrent episodes of eating an amount of food that considerably larger than what the majority of people would consume in a discrete period of time</p></li><li><b>Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder: </b><p>Accounts for more that 50% of the diagnosed eating disorders. Some examples include Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (anorexic behaviors without significantly low weight) and Purging Disorder (recurrent purging for weight loss without binging)</p></li><li><b>Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder: </b><p>Symptoms are characteristic of another disorder, but do not meet the full criteria for a specific disorder</p></li></ul><h5>Why do eating disorders exist?</h5><p>We can’t attribute the onset of eating disorders to a single influence; there are many factors to consider, including dieting culture, media, neurochemistry, and emotion regulation. Our media perpetuates unrealistic body weight and shape goals, influencing many individuals to diet. These diets can become out of hand, leading individuals to disordered thoughts and behaviors surrounding eating and body ideals. However, not all individuals who diet develop an eating disorder; what may put individuals at a higher risk for an eating disorder involves their neurochemistry and emotion regulation. For example, patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) tend to be controlling and lack some feeling of pleasure, while patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) tend to appear under-controlled and emotionally unstable. This abnormal regulation of emotions is related to the brains neurochemistry. Patients with BN tend to have decreased levels of serotonin, while patients with AN tend to have increased levels of serotonin. The lack of serotonin in BN individuals can explain their depression and mood lability. Meanwhile, the anxious and obsessional nature of patients with AN can be attributed to the excess of serotonin. Neurochemistry can also explain the behavior of eating disorder patients; individuals with AN experience a decrease in serotonin when they restrict their food, thus relieving some feelings of anxiety. The existence of eating disorder mentality can be attributed to the ideals and messages portrayed by the media, but the existence of eating disorders also includes altered neurochemistry and emotion regulation.</p>'},
	'medical' : {title: '<b>Medical Consequences from Eating Disorders</b>', info: '<h5>What is malnutrition?</h5> Malnutrition is the deficit or macronutrients or micronutrients. Malnutrition can be classified by a low BMI (body mass index) or by measures of significant weight loss. However, one can be malnourished yet maintain a normal or high BMI. Therefore, the change in weight, including the amount of weight lost and the time frame of weight loss (how fast), is a stronger determinant of malnutrition severity. Malnutrition leads to changes in metabolic rate which can result in damaging homeostatic mechanisms.</p><h5>How are each of the body’s systems affected by malnutrition?</h5><ul><li><b>Cardiovascular:</b><p>Malnutrition can cause bradycardia, or having a heart rate lower than 45 bpm (beats per minute), which increases the risk for cardiac arrest. The body can begin to eat away at the heart for nutrients, decreasing the heart wall mass and cardiac output. This can cause hypotension (low blood pressure), orthostatic changes, and acrocyanosis, or cold and blue hands and feet.</p></li><li><b>Fluids and Electrolytes: </b><p>Dehydration can lead to low blood pressure and put the body into shock, causing organ failure, altered cognition and even death. Dehydration can lead to an imbalance in electrolytes which can cause issues such as cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, coma, and permanent neurological damage. The practice of water loading, or consuming large amounts of fluid, can also cause electrolyte abnormalities through the dilution of electrolytes.</p></li><li><b>Neuropsychiatric: </b><p>Malnutrition can have severe cognitive and neuropsychiatric effects that affect memory, learning, organization, judgment, and concentration. Malnutrition can cause lack of ability to manage emotions and lead to the onset of anxiety, depression, psychosis, or suicide, which is the second leading cause of death from eating disorders. The most damaging can be the loss of white and grey matter in the brain. Since the brain continues to develop until age 25, if damage is done before the end of development, these change may be irreversible.</p></li><li><b>Gastrointestinal: </b><p>Malnutrition can slow a body’s metabolism leading to constipation and delayed gastric emptying. The liver acts as emergency storage, releasing nutrients to keep the blood sugar stable. Therefore, when a person is malnourished, they can experience increased liver enzymes. Other gastrointestinal symptoms include acid reflux, pancreatitis, hematemesis (blood in vomit), and gallstones.</p></li><li><b>Reproductive: </b><p>The effects of malnutrition on the reproductive systems can depend on the individuals stage of development. If puberty is incomplete, malnutrition can cause pubertal delay or pubertal arrest. If puberty is complete, malnutrition can cause loss of menstruation and infertility in women and decreased sex drive in men.</p></li><li><b>Musculoskeletal: </b><p>Malnutrition can cause height stunting, decreased bone density due to weight loss and decreased hormones, and muscular pain and weakness. Both bone density and height growth can be irreversible depending on time of onset and duration.</p></li><li><b>Hematologic: </b><p>Hematologic complications related to malnutrition include anemia, weakened immune system, and low platelets.</p></li><li><b>Head and Neck: </b><p>The effects of eating disorders on the head and neck include many symptoms that are the result of purging including dental decay, loss of teeth, oral abrasions, and carotid hypertrophy (enlarged salivary glands).</p></li><li><b>Dermatologic: </b><p>Lanugo is the excessive body hair growth that can result from malnutrition. Other symptoms include poor wound healing, dry skin, hair loss, and ulcers. The Russell Sign is a callus on the hand knuckles that can appear as the result of purging.</p></li><li><b>Respiratory: </b><p>Purging can lead to aspiration of vomit into the lungs, causing pneumonia.</p></li></ul><h5>What is "refeeding syndrome"?</h5><p>Severe malnutrition can cause the body to forget how to handle food. The reintroduction of food to someone who has gone a long period of time without eating can cause a surge of hormones leading to an imbalance of hormones and possible organ failure. Therefore, the re-nourishment of the body needs to be gradual and closely monitored. Individuals who have been severely malnourished usually require inpatient medical treatment as food and liquid intake, as well as electrolyte levels, are crucial.</p>'},
	'culture' : {title: '<b>Cultural Influences</b>', info: '<h5>What is sociocultural theory?</h5>Sociocultural theory of eating disorders is the most popular theory used to explain the sociocultural influence in the development of eating disorders. It supports that societal pressures to be thin create an internalization of a thin ideal, leading to increased body dissatisfaction and greater risk for dieting, negative thoughts/behavior and the development of an eating disorder. It is not relative to environmental or interpersonal variables such as trauma, dysfunctional family systems, or major life events; these exist in every culture. Sociocultural theory focuses on socially constructed variables with culture specific ideologies that are endorsed through socialization and social cognitive learning.</p><h5>What is internalization of the thin ideal?</h5><p>Internalization of the thin ideal is the degree to which a person’s awareness of the body ideal correlates to body dissatisfaction, or how much they desire the thin ideal. The development of the thin ideal is related to environmental factors, such as media. Internalization of the thin ideal can lead to greater body dissatisfaction and greater risk for negative eating behaviors.</p><h5>What other ways can the development of eating disorders be explained?</h5><p>The Tripartite and Dual Pathway models illustrate the development of eating disorders. The Tripartite model supports that external factors, such as peers, parents, and media, creates further internalization of the thin ideal which then leads to body dissatisfaction. The Dual Pathway model supports that pressure to be thin and internalization of the thin ideal leads to body dissatisfaction. It is this body dissatisfaction that can lead to disordered eating and the onset of an eating disorder. Both the Tripartite and Dual Pathways models believe that cultural messages pressure individuals into practicing cultural norms and that internalizing the thin ideal is a mechanism to mediate that pressure.</p><p>The Objectification Theory discusses how society influences beliefs about ourself. It supports that cultural practices, such as comments and harassment, reinforce the belief that we are only because of our body. This leads to self-objectification, or adoption of the 3rd person view, and the evaluation of oneself based on physical appearance. This turns into self-survelincace, or body monitoring, which can lead to negative experiences and emotions. All of these lead to the onset and development of eating disorder thoughts and behaviors. A study that exemplifies the Objectification Theory is known as the Swimsuit Study. This experiment had two conditions in which men and women performed math problems either wearing a sweater or a swimsuit. The results showed that men had no significant difference in performance, while the women had significantly worse performance while wearing a swimsuit. This is because they were distracted by evaluating themselves in a swimsuit. When we start to objectify ourselves, we body shame because we believe our bodies are not meeting standards. This mindset can lead to disordered eating.</p>'},
	'neurobiology' : {title: '<b>Neurobiology of Eating Disorders</b>', info: '<h5>Do people with eating disorders exhibit a certain temperament and personality?</h5>Individuals with eating disorders exhibit particular temperament and personality traits that can be linked back to the neural circuitry of the brain. These traits are important to the development and continuation of their disorder. Traits that can appear in childhood include:</p><ul><li>Perfectionism</li><li>Achievement oriented</li><li>Obsessive nature</li><li>Sensitive to criticism, mistake, and punishment</li><li>Impulsivity</li><li>Anxiousness</li><li>Rule abiding</li><li>Avoids situations with uncertainty</li></ul>The general characteristics of the temperament of individuals with eating disorders includes:</p><ol><li>Elevated anxiety/harm avoidance</li><li>Altered reward sensitivity</li><li>Altered cognitive flexibility/inhibition</li><li>Altered interoceptive awareness</li></ol><p>These traits are encoded in the brain circuitry and can reinforce appetite dysregulation and disordered eating.</p><h5>Do people with eating disorders experience abnormal reinforcement of reward and inhibition?</h5><p>Our brains learn through the reinforcement of reward and punishment. The limbic circuit, which is responsible for emotional response and reward valuation, is important for motivation. For example, when a person is hungry, the limbic circuit encodes a positive experience when food is consumed to reinforce motivation for food. On the other hand, the cognitive control circuit is responsible for inhibition and decision making. If we experience something bad, this encoded through the cognitive control circuit as a negative experience to decrease motivation. We now see this bad experience as risky and learn to avoid it in the future. Individuals with anorexia experience stronger control of their cognitive control circuit, leading to difficult in encoding reward and motivation. While hunger normally encourages motivation for food through the limbic circuit, those with anorexia have stronger control from their cognitive control circuit and therefore feel inhibition or the need to avoid food.</p><h5>How do people with people with eating disorders experience hunger and taste?</h5><p>Those with eating disorders experience a discrepancy between their physical need to eat and their drive to eat. A study looked at individuals with restricting and binging eating disorders and compared activation in their brains to the taste of sucrose (sugar) following a 16 hour fast and after consuming a meal. Normally, hunger activates the reward systems in the brain to induce motivation for high-calorie foods. However, the study found that those with restricting eating disorders have abnormally low activation to taste in their reward systems when hungry. This suggests that those with restricting eating disorders experience lower sensitivity of their reward systems leading to decreased motivation from hunger signals, supporting their ability to restrict food intake even when starved. The same study found that those with binging eating disorders have abnormally high activation to taste in their reward system following eating. This suggests that their reward response doesn’t decrease when they feel full; the brain doesn’t signal to stop eating, supporting their ability to eat beyond fullness.</p>'}
